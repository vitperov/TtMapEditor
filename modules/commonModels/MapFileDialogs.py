    Each editor kind keeps its maps somewhere different (Terrain and House sit
    in unrelated folders in the game project), so one instance is built per
    editor with the accessor for its own setting.

    The setting is re-read for every dialog, so changing it in Settings takes
    effect without restarting the editor. An unset or missing directory falls
    back to the editor-local scratch folder, which keeps the editor usable
    without a game project checked out.
